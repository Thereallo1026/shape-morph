All React exports are available from the `shape-morph/react` entry point. Requires React 18+.

```tsx
import { Shape, useMorph, useShape } from "shape-morph/react";
import type { ShapeName } from "shape-morph/react";
```

## `<Shape>`

```tsx
<Shape name="Heart" size={32} fill="red" />
```

Renders a shape as an inline `<svg>` element.

<AutoTypeTable path="../src/react/shape.tsx" name="ShapeProps" />

## `useMorph`

```ts
useMorph(start: ShapeName, end: ShapeName, options: MorphOptions): MorphResult
```

Animated morph hook. Runs a `requestAnimationFrame` loop with two animation modes: duration-based (with customizable easing, default ease-in-out) and lerp-based (each frame moves a fraction toward the target).

### Options

<AutoTypeTable path="../src/react/use-morph.ts" name="MorphOptions" />

### Returns

<AutoTypeTable path="../src/react/use-morph.ts" name="MorphOutput" />

The returned `progress` is the animated value, not the target. In duration mode it interpolates using the provided easing function (default ease-in-out — see [Easing](/docs/api/easing) for presets). In lerp mode it moves a fraction toward the target each frame. Use it to drive synchronized animations:

```tsx
const { clipPath, progress } = useMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
  progress: hovered ? 1 : 0,
  duration: 300,
});

<div style={{
  clipPath,
  transform: `rotate(${progress * 90}deg)`,
}} />
```

## `useShape`

```ts
useShape(name: ShapeName, size?: number): ShapeResult
```

Returns path data for a static shape. No animation.

### Returns

<AutoTypeTable path="../src/react/use-shape.ts" name="ShapeOutput" />

Builder functions for creating custom `RoundedPolygon` instances.

```ts
import { createStar, createCircle, createRectangle, createPolygon, cornerRounding } from "shape-morph";
```

## `createCircle`

```ts
createCircle(vertices?: number): RoundedPolygon
```

Creates a circle approximation using cubic Bezier curves. Default is 8 vertices. More vertices = smoother circle.

## `createRectangle`

```ts
createRectangle(width: number, height: number, rounding?: CornerRounding): RoundedPolygon
```

Creates a rectangle with optional corner rounding.

## `createStar`

```ts
createStar(
  points: number,
  outerRadius: number,
  innerRadius: number,
  rounding: CornerRounding
): RoundedPolygon
```

Creates a star polygon. `innerRadius` is relative to `outerRadius` - a value of `0.5` means the inner points are halfway to the center.

## `createPolygon`

```ts
createPolygon(vertices: number, rounding: CornerRounding): RoundedPolygon
```

Creates a regular polygon (triangle, pentagon, hexagon, etc.) with the given number of vertices.

## `cornerRounding`

```ts
cornerRounding(radius: number, smoothing?: number): CornerRounding
```

Creates a corner rounding configuration.

- **radius** (0–1): Fraction of edge length used for rounding. `0` is sharp, `1` rounds the entire edge.
- **smoothing** (0–1, default `0`): Cubic Bezier easing applied to the rounding. `0` gives circular arcs, higher values produce softer organic curves.

## `RoundedPolygon`

The base shape class. Key methods:

### `.normalized(): RoundedPolygon`

Returns a copy centered at the origin and scaled to fit within a unit circle. **Required before passing custom polygons to `Morph`.**

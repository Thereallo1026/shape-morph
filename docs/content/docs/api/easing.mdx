title: Easing
description: Built-in easing functions for shape animations.
---

Easing presets for use with the `useMorph` hook's `easing` option or your own animation loops. Each is a `(t: number) => number` function where `t` goes from 0 to 1.

```ts
import { linear, easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut, easeInOutCubic } from "shape-morph";
```

## `linear`

```ts
const linear = (t: number): number => t;
```

No easing. Useful for scroll-driven animations or manual control where you're already providing your own timing.

## `easeIn`

```ts
const easeIn = (t: number): number => t * t;
```

Quadratic ease-in. Starts slow, accelerates. Use for elements leaving the screen.

## `easeOut`

```ts
const easeOut = (t: number): number => 1 - (1 - t) ** 2;
```

Quadratic ease-out. Starts fast, decelerates. Use for elements entering the screen.

## `easeInOut`

```ts
const easeInOut = (t: number): number =>
  t < 0.5 ? 2 * t * t : 1 - (-2 * t + 2) ** 2 / 2;
```

Quadratic ease-in-out. This is the default easing for `useMorph` when no `easing` option is provided.

## `easeInOutCubic`

```ts
const easeInOutCubic = (t: number): number =>
  t < 0.5 ? 4 * t * t * t : 1 - (-2 * t + 2) ** 3 / 2;
```

Cubic ease-in-out. Smoother and more pronounced than the quadratic variant.

## Custom easing

The `easing` option accepts any function with the signature `(t: number) => number`. Write your own or use a library:

```ts
import { useMorph } from "shape-morph/react";

const { clipPath } = useMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
  progress: hovered ? 1 : 0,
  duration: 500,
  easing: (t) => 1 - Math.cos((t * Math.PI) / 2), // sine ease-out
});
```

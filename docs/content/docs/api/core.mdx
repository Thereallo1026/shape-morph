All core exports are available from the `shape-morph` entry point.

```ts
import { Morph, getShape, shapeNames } from "shape-morph";
```

## `Morph`

```ts
new Morph(start: RoundedPolygon, end: RoundedPolygon)
```

Creates a morph between two shapes. Handles feature-matching, subdivision, and interpolation internally.

### `morph.asCubics(progress: number): Cubic[]`

Returns the interpolated cubic curves at the given progress (0–1). Progress 0 is the start shape, 1 is the end shape.

## `getShape`

```ts
getShape(name: ShapeName): RoundedPolygon
```

Returns a preset Material Design 3 shape as a `RoundedPolygon`. See [Available Shapes](/docs/shapes) for the full list.

## `shapeNames`

```ts
const shapeNames: readonly ShapeName[]
```

Array of all 35 shape names. Useful for iteration.

## `ShapeName`

```ts
type ShapeName = "Circle" | "Square" | "Heart" | ... // 35 total
```

Union type of all valid shape names. Available from both `shape-morph` and `shape-morph/react`.

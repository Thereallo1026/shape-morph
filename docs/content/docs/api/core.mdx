description: Core morph and shape APIs.
---

All core exports are available from the `shape-morph` entry point.

```ts
import { AnimatedMorph, Morph, getShape, shapeNames } from "shape-morph";
```

## `Morph`

```ts
new Morph(start: RoundedPolygon, end: RoundedPolygon)
```

Creates a morph between two shapes. Handles feature-matching, subdivision, and interpolation internally.

### `morph.asCubics(progress: number): Cubic[]`

Returns the interpolated cubic curves at the given progress (0-1). Progress 0 is the start shape, 1 is the end shape.

## `AnimatedMorph`

```ts
new AnimatedMorph(start: ShapeName | RoundedPolygon, end: ShapeName | RoundedPolygon, options: AnimatedMorphOptions)
```

Animated morph for vanilla JS. Set the `progress` property and the class animates from the current position, calling `onFrame` each frame. Supports three animation modes, the same as the React [`useMorph`](/docs/api/react#usemorph) hook: duration-based (with customizable easing), lerp-based, and spring physics.

```ts
import { AnimatedMorph } from "shape-morph";

const morph = new AnimatedMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
  duration: 300,
  onFrame({ clipPath }) {
    div.style.clipPath = clipPath;
  },
});

div.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => { morph.progress = 1; });
div.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => { morph.progress = 0; });
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `duration` | `number` | `300` | Animation duration in ms. Cannot use with `lerp` or `spring`. |
| `easing` | `(t: number) => number` | `easeInOut` | Easing function. Cannot use with `lerp` or `spring`. See [Easing](/docs/api/easing). |
| `lerp` | `number` | - | Lerp factor (0-1). Cannot use with `duration`, `easing`, or `spring`. |
| `spring` | [`SpringConfig`](/docs/api/spring) | - | Spring physics config. Cannot use with `duration`, `easing`, or `lerp`. |
| `samples` | `number` | `4` | Samples per cubic for polygon output |
| `size` | `number` | `100` | Output size for `pathD` |
| `onFrame` | `(frame) => void` | required | Called each animation frame |

### Frame object

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pathD` | `string` | SVG path `d` attribute |
| `clipPath` | `string` | CSS `clip-path: polygon(...)` |
| `progress` | `number` | Current animated progress. May overshoot 0-1 in spring mode. |

### `morph.progress`

Setting `progress` triggers animation from the current position to the new target. Reading it returns the last set target.

### `morph.dispose()`

Cancels any running animation. Call this when removing the element or cleaning up.

## `getShape`

```ts
getShape(name: ShapeName): RoundedPolygon
```

Returns a preset Material Design 3 shape as a `RoundedPolygon`. See [Available Shapes](/docs/shapes) for the full list.

## `shapeNames`

```ts
const shapeNames: ShapeName[]
```

Array of all 35 shape names. Useful for iteration.

## `ShapeName`

```ts
type ShapeName = "Circle" | "Square" | "Heart" | ... // 35 total
```

Union type of all valid shape names. Available from both `shape-morph` and `shape-morph/react`.

title: Spring
description: Spring physics animation for shape morphing.
---

Spring mode simulates a physical spring, the value accelerates toward the target, overshoots, bounces back, and settles. This gives a natural, organic feel that's hard to replicate with easing curves.

```ts
import type { SpringConfig } from "shape-morph";
```

## `SpringConfig`

<AutoTypeTable path="../src/spring.ts" name="SpringConfig" />

Both properties are optional and have sensible defaults.

## How it works

Each animation frame, the spring simulation updates velocity and position:

```
force = stiffness × (target - position)
friction = damping × velocity
velocity += (force - friction) × dt
position += velocity × dt
```

The animation stops when both the distance to target and velocity are near zero.

## Stiffness

Controls how much force pulls toward the target. Higher values make the animation snappier.

| Value | Feel |
|---|---|
| `100` | Gentle, slow |
| `180` | Balanced (default) |
| `300` | Snappy, fast |

## Damping

Controls friction. Higher values reduce oscillation and make the spring settle faster.

| Value | Feel |
|---|---|
| `8` | Bouncy, lots of overshoot |
| `12` | Moderate bounce (default) |
| `20` | Minimal overshoot, quick settle |

## Overshoot

Unlike duration and lerp modes, spring `progress` can temporarily go past 1 or below 0 during the bounce. The shape output (`pathD`, `clipPath`) is always clamped to valid 0-1 range, but the raw `progress` value is not. Use it to drive overshoot effects on other properties:

```tsx
const { clipPath, progress } = useMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
  progress: hovered ? 1 : 0,
  spring: { stiffness: 180, damping: 12 },
});

<div style={{
  clipPath,
  // progress overshoots past 1, so rotation goes past 90° and bounces back
  transform: `rotate(${progress * 90}deg)`,
}} />
```

## Usage with `useMorph`

```tsx
import { useMorph } from "shape-morph/react";

const { clipPath } = useMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
  progress: hovered ? 1 : 0,
  spring: { stiffness: 200, damping: 15 },
});
```

Cannot combine `spring` with `duration`, `easing`, or `lerp`.

## Usage with `AnimatedMorph`

```ts
import { AnimatedMorph } from "shape-morph";

const morph = new AnimatedMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
  spring: { stiffness: 200, damping: 15 },
  onFrame({ clipPath }) {
    div.style.clipPath = clipPath;
  },
});

morph.progress = 1;
```

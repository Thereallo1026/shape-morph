title: SVG Paths
description: Render shapes as SVG path elements.

The core API outputs shapes as SVG path `d` attribute strings. Use these with `<path>` elements in any SVG context.

## Single shape

```ts
import { getShape, toSvgPath } from "shape-morph";

const heart = getShape("Heart");
const d = toSvgPath(heart, 100); // 100px size
```

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <path d={d} fill="red" />
</svg>
```

## Morphed shape

```ts
import { getShape, Morph, toPathD } from "shape-morph";

const start = getShape("Circle");
const end = getShape("Heart");
const morph = new Morph(start, end);

// Get the midpoint between Circle and Heart
const d = toPathD(morph.asCubics(0.5), 100);
```

`toPathD` takes the cubic curves from `morph.asCubics(progress)` and converts them to a path string. The second argument is the output size in pixels.

## Progress values

- `0` - the start shape (Circle in this example)
- `1` - the end shape (Heart)
- `0.5` - exact midpoint
- Any float between 0 and 1 is valid

The morph handles feature-matching automatically. Both shapes are subdivided so they have the same number of cubic segments, regardless of their original complexity.

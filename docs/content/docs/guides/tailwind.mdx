description: Use shape-morph utilities as Tailwind CSS v4 classes.
---

For Tailwind CSS v4, shape-morph ships a pre-built utility stylesheet. Import it alongside Tailwind and use `clip-{shape}` classes directly, no JavaScript is needed.

## Setup

Import the stylesheet in your CSS entry point:

```css title="app.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "shape-morph/tailwind.css";
```

## Usage

Apply `clip-*` utility classes to any element:

```html
<img
  src="/photo.jpg"
  class="clip-heart hover:clip-circle transition-[clip-path] duration-300"
/>
```

All 35 Material Design 3 shapes are available as `clip-*` utilities (e.g. `clip-circle`, `clip-heart`, `clip-diamond`, `clip-cookie-9-sided`). Since every shape produces a `polygon()` with the same number of vertices, CSS transitions between any two shapes work seamlessly.

## Available classes

| Class | Shape |
|---|---|
| `clip-circle` | Circle |
| `clip-square` | Square |
| `clip-slanted` | Slanted |
| `clip-arch` | Arch |
| `clip-fan` | Fan |
| `clip-arrow` | Arrow |
| `clip-semi-circle` | SemiCircle |
| `clip-oval` | Oval |
| `clip-pill` | Pill |
| `clip-triangle` | Triangle |
| `clip-diamond` | Diamond |
| `clip-clam-shell` | ClamShell |
| `clip-pentagon` | Pentagon |
| `clip-gem` | Gem |
| `clip-sunny` | Sunny |
| `clip-very-sunny` | VerySunny |
| `clip-cookie-4-sided` | Cookie4Sided |
| `clip-cookie-6-sided` | Cookie6Sided |
| `clip-cookie-7-sided` | Cookie7Sided |
| `clip-cookie-9-sided` | Cookie9Sided |
| `clip-cookie-12-sided` | Cookie12Sided |
| `clip-ghostish` | Ghostish |
| `clip-clover-4-leaf` | Clover4Leaf |
| `clip-clover-8-leaf` | Clover8Leaf |
| `clip-burst` | Burst |
| `clip-soft-burst` | SoftBurst |
| `clip-boom` | Boom |
| `clip-soft-boom` | SoftBoom |
| `clip-flower` | Flower |
| `clip-puffy` | Puffy |
| `clip-puffy-diamond` | PuffyDiamond |
| `clip-pixel-circle` | PixelCircle |
| `clip-pixel-triangle` | PixelTriangle |
| `clip-bun` | Bun |
| `clip-heart` | Heart |

## How it works

The stylesheet contains `@utility` directives, the preferred way for Tailwind v4 to define custom utilities in CSS. Each utility sets `clip-path` to a pre-computed `polygon()` value. Because this is pure CSS, it works with all Tailwind features like responsive prefixes, hover states, and transitions.

For programmatic access or morphing between shapes, see the [CSS Clip-Path](/docs/guides/css-clip-path) guide.

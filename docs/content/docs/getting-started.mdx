description: Install shape-morph and render your first shape.

## Installation

```package-install
shape-morph
```

The core package has zero dependencies. The `shape-morph/react` entry point requires React 18+ as a peer dependency.

## Your first shape

The fastest way to render a shape is with the React component:

```tsx
import { Shape } from "shape-morph/react";

<Shape name="Heart" size={32} fill="red" />
```

Or use the core API directly:

```ts
import { getShape, toSvgPath } from "shape-morph";

const heart = getShape("Heart");
const d = toSvgPath(heart, 100);
// Use as <path d={d} />
```

## Your first morph

```ts
import { getShape, Morph, toPathD } from "shape-morph";

const start = getShape("Circle");
const end = getShape("Heart");
const morph = new Morph(start, end);

// progress: 0 = Circle, 1 = Heart, 0.5 = midpoint
const d = toPathD(morph.asCubics(0.5), 100);
```

The `Morph` class handles feature-matching and subdivision automatically. Call `asCubics(progress)` at any value between 0 and 1 to get the interpolated shape.

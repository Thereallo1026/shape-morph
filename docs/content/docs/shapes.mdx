title: Available Shapes
description: All 35 built-in Material Design 3 shapes.
---

The library ships 35 preset shapes from the Material Design 3 shape system. Use any of these names with `getShape()`, `<Shape>`, `useMorph`, or `useShape`.

## Shape names

<ShapeGallery />

## Usage

```ts
import { getShape, shapeNames } from "shape-morph";

// Get a specific shape
const heart = getShape("Heart");

// Iterate all shape names
for (const name of shapeNames) {
  const shape = getShape(name);
}
```

```tsx
import { Shape } from "shape-morph/react";

<Shape name="Cookie9Sided" size={48} fill="#6750A4" />
```

All shape names are available as the `ShapeName` type for TypeScript autocomplete:

```ts
import type { ShapeName } from "shape-morph";
// or
import type { ShapeName } from "shape-morph/react";
```

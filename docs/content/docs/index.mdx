description: Material Design 3 shape morphing for the web.
---

**shape-morph** is a TypeScript port of Android's `androidx.graphics.shapes` library. It gives you Material Design 3 shapes as SVG paths, CSS `clip-path` strings, or React components. With morphing.

## What it does

Every shape is a `RoundedPolygon` built from cubic Bezier curves. Each corner has a configurable radius and smoothing value. The library ships **35 preset shapes** and lets you create your own.

Morphing works by feature-matching two shapes with completely different structures. A Circle has 8 cubic curves. A Heart has 16. The `Morph` class aligns them by detecting convex corners, concave corners, and flat edges, then subdivides both shapes so they have the same number of segments. Interpolate at any progress between 0 and 1.

## Output formats

- **SVG path** - `toPathD()` returns a `d` attribute string for `<path>` elements
- **CSS clip-path** - `toClipPathPolygon()` returns a `polygon(...)` string with fixed vertex count, so CSS transitions work natively
- **React** - `<Shape>` component and `useMorph` hook with built-in `requestAnimationFrame` animation

## Quick example

```tsx
import { useMorph } from "shape-morph/react";

function Avatar({ hovered }: { hovered: boolean }) {
  const { clipPath } = useMorph("Circle", "Heart", {
    progress: hovered ? 1 : 0,
    duration: 300,
  });

  return <img style={{ clipPath }} src="/avatar.png" />;
}
```
